All right, Iâ€™ve had it.
I donâ€™t normally get mad. Â I donâ€™t normally post about it. Â But really? Â Iâ€™ve had enough now.
In the last few days, there have been *dozens* of articles coming out in major media outlets that are absolutely filled with hate and anger towards families that donâ€™t  vaccinate. Â Itâ€™s an unbelievable overreaction to the â€œDisneyland Measlesâ€? outbreak (which is actually, so far, much smaller than other recent outbreaks â€” so why is it such a big deal?). Â This fight has reached an absolute fever pitch.
Weâ€™re also dealing with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny being denied at venues in Australia, with some people wanting to deny her a visa to even enter the country.
There isÂ bullying, nastiness, insanity from every corner. Â Weâ€™re at the peak now. Â And itâ€™s affecting people in their everyday lives. Â More and more are having to read tirades in their Facebook newsfeeds about how stupid â€œanti-vaxxersâ€? are, or endure personal berating over their familyâ€™s choices. Â Some are encouraging people to find out which children in their childâ€™s classroom arenâ€™t vaccinated so they can ostracize them. Â Some are refusing to allow unvaccinated children into church nurseries, playgroups, and more. Â PerfectlyÂ healthy children, who happen to not have been vaccinated.
Iâ€™ve even been told that some of my readers have been messaged by trolls and harassed, simply for participating in some of the threads on my Facebook page! Â Thatâ€™s just going too far.
So, Iâ€™ve had enough. Â 
Families who believe in  vaccine choice, itâ€™s time to stand up. Â I know itâ€™s hard, with all the hate. Â But if we sit silently and let them rage and fight, theyâ€™ll strip our rights. Â Yes, itâ€™s easier to be quiet and hope people donâ€™t know who we are, so that we donâ€™t have to deal with the brunt of the anger directly. Â If we are silent, theyÂ win. Â And they cannot win. Â They areÂ wrong. Â They are wrong to bully people into their way of thinking. Â They are wrong to try to force their will on others. Â And they wonâ€™t do it, if I have anything to say about it.
Luckily, since I have this platformâ€¦I do have something to say about it.
Thereâ€™s a sore lack of facts right now in the media about the â€œDisneyland Measlesâ€? as well as measles in general. Â So letâ€™s just share some.
We canâ€™t make the leap, from what we do know, that this was â€œcaused by unvaccinated people.â€? Â We simply canâ€™t. Â That is just an easy scapegoat. Â If fits their agenda â€” to stir up hate and anger towards people who make alternative  vaccination decisions, in order to try to strip exemptions and peoplesâ€™ rights. Â (No,Â nobody has the right to force medical care of any sort on anyone else. Â Period.)
But, of course, thereâ€™s a lot more to it than that.
Basic facts about measles:
The measles is just not a serious illness for most people. Â We also know far, far more about it now than we did 60 years ago, and medical science has advanced quite a lot as well. Â We know how to prevent the most serious complications now in most cases. Â If we stopped vaccinating, more kids would get measles, and the vast majority with no issues. Â We would not see rampant blindness (since  vitamin A supplementation is easy to get and inexpensive).
We would not see rampant death or encephalitis (these are very rare anyway). Â If the death rate was really 1 in 5000 (and itâ€™s hard to say, with the advanced medical care, if it would be that high), and everyone got measles â€” we could assume about 4 million cases per year â€” that would be 800 deaths annually. Â Just to compare, there are around 35,000 deaths from car accidents annually, while preventable medical errors kill around 400,000 people annually. Â We might see a reduction in autoimmunity and other lifelong health complications as wellâ€¦but that hasnâ€™t been thoroughly studied.
Are complicationsÂ possible? Â Yes, of course. Â But I, personally, look at the whole picture and not at worst-case scenarios. Â We donâ€™t have adequate safety testing on the MMR. Â It doesnâ€™t provide lifelong immunity, and it requires at least two doses (and theyâ€™re considering adding a third) â€” each dose comes with its own set of risks, doubling (or tripling) your overall risk.
Iâ€™m not going to tell you whatÂ you should decide here. Â If you feel the MMR is the safer course of action, then by all means. Â Iâ€™m trying to cut through the nonsense and share a more accurate, scientific picture of whatâ€™s going on right now, instead of wild suppositions about all those â€œanti-vaxxers.â€? Â (By the way, I love science. Â Accurate science. Â Appropriately applied science. Â Iâ€™m not such a fan of â€œmy science is better than yours,â€? which a few trolls seriously said to me.)
Iâ€™ve written more on measles here, and here, and here. Iâ€™ve addressed the ridiculousness that is â€œherd immunityâ€? here, and here.
If youâ€™re as tired of the bullying as I am, itâ€™s time to stand up for our rights and take the world back. Â We shouldnâ€™t have to listen to hate speech because weâ€™ve made a different medical decision.
First, sign this petition. Â It protects our rights to make our own medical decisions. Â Itâ€™s around 2300 signatures right now; letâ€™s get it to 10,000! Â You can sign if you fully  vaccinate, partially, or donâ€™t â€” as long as you believe parents should have the right to make that decision for themselves.
Second, share the facts. Â Feel free to copy and paste any of the facts from above (citations are hyperlinked) and share them on any threads where people are blaming â€œanti-vaxxersâ€? or getting nasty or scared over the measles. Â Help to correct the misinformation. Â Feel free to share this post, too.
Third, speak up. Â If people are being rude, call them out. Â Be respectful, but say something. Â â€œWe all make different medical decisions for our children. Â The evidence is not clear cut. Â Being rude isnâ€™t going to change anyoneâ€™s mind, and Iâ€™m asking you to stop talking to others like this.â€? Â I suggest deleting and banning anyone who canâ€™t remain civil. Â If youâ€™re ready, share some information on your personal Facebook profile, or talk to friends in person. Â Remain calm and let everyone know how hurtful and harmful this sort of negative attitude is.
Fourth, report hate pages. Â There are a number of different ones on Facebook. Â â€œAnti-Vax Wall of Shame.â€? Â â€œThings Anti-Vaxxers Say.â€? Â â€œBanned by Modern Alternative Mama.â€? Â There are many others. Â Report them for hate speech. Â Their entire purpose is to take screenshots from groups where they troll and mock the people â€” some of you may recognize your own comments being mocked on those pages!
Fifth, write to your Congress representatives and let them know how important preserving/adding to  vaccine exemptions is to you, and preserving medical freedom. Â Search â€œstate representativesâ€? or â€œstate senatorsâ€? to find your stateâ€™s website, and your local representatives. Â In some states there are specific efforts underway; check www.nvic.org for updates on these.
Stand up for your rights, or others will take them from you. Â We canâ€™t allow that.
EDIT: Plenty of people are upset that I noted that we could see up to 800 measles deaths annually if no one vaccinated. Â First, that will never happen â€” because unlike some people, I believe everyone should have a *choice* in their medical care, and many will choose to  vaccinate. Â That is fine. Â (Although vaccination isnâ€™t 100%, as we all know.) Â Second, those people completely ignored that there are currently 400,000 deaths annually fromÂ preventable medical mistakes. Â I donâ€™t understand how this is acceptable, but even *one* death from the measles is not. Â Are you serious? Â Where is your commonsense? Â How can you be angrier about theoretical deaths than hundreds of thousands ofÂ actual deaths? Â I canâ€™t wrap my brain around that one.
Finally, if you post nastiness and hate â€” as many have attempted to do â€” donâ€™t expect it to get published. Â It wonâ€™t. Â Call me Hitler, Stalin, Kim Jong Il, a baby killer, whatever you want. Â I control what gets posted here. Â Keep it civil or youâ€™ll never see it live.
I have to say, I love how the statistics you quote come straight from the CDC and other â€œcredibleâ€? sources; Iâ€™m not saying I discount the websites that are blatantly â€œanti-vax,â€? but I know a lot of other people do, especially the kinds of people who are posting and reposting all of the hateful posts out there right now.  
Great post! Iâ€™m disgusted with the behavior I have been seeing over the last couple of years. Ironically, these bullies are the very reason I started questioning vaccines in the first place. I was pretty pro-vax until I saw the hateful backlash that happened to any medical professional that dared to speak against the mainstream medical (i.e., big pharma funded) community. I have even see some of these people whip each other up and encourage each other to make false claims to CPS, removing healthy children from loving homes and putting them in overcrowded foster care systems where they are then more likely to be exposed to all kinds of neglect and abuses. (There are certainly some wonderful foster families out there and I know some, but the norm is that these kids do not do well.) CPS and DHS should not have their time and resources taken away from kids who are suffering from true neglect and abuse and it makes me sick that these pieces of garbage are so attached to their vaccine dogma that they donâ€™t consider that. 
We can manage some of the negative effects trolling and cyber-bullying is having on us by remember to unplug. Step away from the hate. If youâ€™re experiencing it in your personal world by pressure from family members, refuse to discuss the issue. As Iâ€™ve told my very well-meaning family members â€œmy childâ€™s medical history is between us and him and his physician. We are not going to discuss it with you.â€? Iâ€™m happy to answer general questions, debate information as long as itâ€™s civil, but they donâ€™t get a say in this. Simple as that. 
May we remember to focus our energy on the the things that matter (demanding *real* safety studies, pushing for legislation to protect our rights and hold vaccine manufactures financially accountable for the products, for example). All this arguing is a distraction. 
It is said that one day the Buddha was walking through a village. A very angry and rude young man came up and began insulting him, saying all kind of rude words.
The Buddha was not upset by these insults. Instead he asked the young man, â€œTell me, if you buy a gift for someone, and that person does not take it, to whom does the gift belong?â€?
The Buddha smiled and said, â€œThat is correct. And it is exactly the same with your anger. If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, then the anger falls back on you. You are then the only one who becomes unhappy, not me. All you have done is hurt yourself.â€?
The way that some of this has come about is unfortunate. It is clear that anyone who believes so strongly in anything would not change their stance so readily, especially when opponents do so in an attacking and self-righteous manner. I would like to apologize on behalf of such people, as over time they have forced you and others to take an extreme position. I do not believe that you, or anyone who follows you and the anti-vaccination movement, wishes to harm children, you are trying to do the opposite. However, I invite you to consider other sides of your arguments and their basis before disregarding them. I would like everyone to keep an open dialogue about the issues involved in order to solve them for the future. Thank you everyone, please keep an open mind and respectful dialogue while we all work out the issues.
Here ya go:
Vaccinations arenâ€™t for preventing. Iâ€™m a medical assistant and too many people get that miss info. Itâ€™s keep you from having fatal symptoms like blindness, men not able to have kids as adults and death. Works the same with the flu. It means you can still get it but a softer case of it. Iâ€™m in the middle. I gave my son some of the vaccines but not all of them. Itâ€™s a hard subject. I struggle with it all the time. I hear so any things. I mean I was told other things with raising my son and have sort of proved them wrong. Maybe my son is one of the exceptions. I had to bottle feed my son. I was told that breastfeeding will help them not get sick as much. My son is rarely sick. My brothers kids are breastfed and seems they get sick all the time. I found out about this whole vaccine thing after I gave my son the vaccinations. Even not knowing he didnâ€™t receive four of them. Iâ€™m just in the middle. As a health care professional  I see the pro vaccination side of it and on the other hand is see the right to choose has valid points too. Itâ€™s overwhelming sometimes. But hate is stupid. We live in a free county for a reason to live freely and raise our children we think is best. Hate and bullying is never the answer to anything.
Iâ€™d like to know who said they arenâ€™t for preventing disease. Are they health related professionals or is it others who have automatically assumed itâ€™s to prevent. Wrong info can spread like wild fire and then cam be considered what is. In all my classes every single one of my professors have drilled it into our minds about vaccinations because because we have to be advocates on the information about what we are doing or giving them. If you look at every single adverse side affect in every procedure done or down to things over the counter people would not do anything. You know in studies, even if itâ€™s one person out of thousands who who get that side effect, they have to legally list that as a possible side effect but it is listed as rare. The ingredient that everyone said is toxic was a preservative that the FDA pulled from being allowed to use I believe  it was like 2006. Yes it may happen but you have a higher chance of your child dying from a car crash then from them having adverse side effects from vaccines. I just want to make sure true info is being put out there. I have no problems with parents not vaccinating or vaccinating. Itâ€™s your right as a parent but please make sure you really get all info that is considered non biased.
Kate,  Iâ€™m wondering what proof would be enough for you?  I agree bullying doesnâ€™t work but it seems that evidence doesnâ€™t either.  What proof and from whom would be enough to prove to you that if your children are healthy, you should vaccinate them?  99% of the pediatricians in this country support vaccinations, 100% of scientists support them, and so do a vast majority of parents.  Thatâ€™s enough evidence for me but obviously not for you.  What would it take for you to change your mind?  If 99% of pediatricians told me that vaccines were not safe, I would believe them.  They were trained (for years) to protect and heal our children so when essentially every last one of them tells me that vaccines are safe for healthy children, I believe them.  Oddly enough they all also vaccinate their own children â€“ so that old â€œThey are in big pharmaâ€™s pocketsâ€? either makes them psychopaths or willing to risk their own childrenâ€™s lives.  If you believe that about pediatricians, I certainly hope you donâ€™t bring your children to one.
My personal struggle is because after deciding to vax (selectively, slowly, not really believing in it) and taking all sorts of heat for not doing it the usual way, my daughter had an adverse reaction to IPV, her first shot.  The doctor we first took her to pooh poohed it and gave her the first shot of the DTaP series, and she reacted again.  So suddenly Iâ€™m a credible person, because we have a history of adverse reactions.  But my original hesitancy to vax was not respectable, even though it turned out to be well-founded.  The lack of respect has been astounding to me.
Itâ€™s also frustrating that while the angry voices say Iâ€™m okay, an exception to the rule, when they say there should be criminal liability, or that unvaxed kids should be prohibited from attending school (or Disney world!), if they are being consistent, they have to include my unvaxed kids, who are every bit as dangerous as the unvaxed kids whose parents simply chose not to, before they had any adverse effects to wave around.
I am not angry. I will not be hateful. I am simply stating a few facts from the other side which I do hope you please share. I have never gotten upset at another persons choice to not vaccinate. Ever. When I was a child I was exposed to the chicken pox so my friend and I could be sick together too. Guess what happened? The virus caused a seizure. The seizure caused a benign lesion in my brain and Iâ€™ve had epilepsy ever since. This is not a pity party. It has made me the person I am today  So many things could be so much worse. I know a woman who because of the measles developed an autoimmune disorder and wasnâ€™t able to conceive. Had 2 terrible miscarriages, one with twins at 5 months. I know of far too many people who have had to avoid others because of illness in their family (cancer, elderly parents, etc.)â€¦ they have small children and couldnâ€™t have friends over if they werenâ€™t vaccinated or if their children were not of the age yet to get the vaccines making them vulnerable to them, at which point making the ill parent (cancer, stem cell recipient) vulnerable to the illness. Iâ€™m only 35. I feel this is young enough to know far too many people (and this isnâ€™t the entire list) which this affected. My father got whooping cough when my son was born 4 years ago and he couldnâ€™t meet him until he was 2 months old (they live 10 miles away). Like I said. I respect the decisions that other people make, but I do find it frustrating at the same time. To say that there are just â€œsmallâ€? examples is very hard for me to hear when I know so many people that have been affected by that â€œsmallâ€? population. I do realize it sure sounds like all I know is a bunch of sick people, that is not the case. I live in a place where many people choose not to vaccinate and this is the result. Weâ€™ve had entire preschools shut down because the entire (entire) school came down with whooping cough. Now, think about the fact that when the child gets sick itâ€™s not just the child. The siblings (if there are any) get sick as well. The parents (who then have to miss work) the other people they have come in contact with, if the sibling goes to another school and the siblings go to a different school where they arenâ€™t immunized then it is then spreading there to those families (parents, siblings, people they have come in contact with â€“ what if they have older siblings who go to different schools). Then what about the co-workers of the parents? This is the mindset of the pro-vaccine people. Much of the time people are too upset to bother explaining any of it. I know it sounds like a big conspiracy theory. If you stop and think about how the common cold is spread, itâ€™s the same. The exact same, but the illness are so much more powerful and when we have the gift (how our side views it) of prevention (when people like me have had unfortunate lifelong side effects from them) we snatch them up.
 I really hope you choose to post this seeing how I have put this in the kindest way I know how.
When making our decision, we called the CDC (whom I will not call a reputable source for anything, but maybe a vaccine agenda monger).  I was particularly wanting statistical facts regarding the hib b vaccine. My specific question was: in any given recent year of the cases of meningitis that could have been prevented by the vaccine, how many of the cases reported of infected were vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. Their response was, â€œwe do not keep that kind of data and if we did, it is a hippa violation to release any information.â€?  I like facts, statistics and truth.  The pro vaxxers think an unvacinated child poses a threat to their child.  The logic is bad fundamentally. If vaccines worked no amount if unvaccinated would pose a threat. Thank you for your article.
Hi Kate. Iâ€™m a physician, and I just wanted to address one thing you mentioned:  the preventable medical errors that happen in hospitals. They do happen, and youâ€™re right, thatâ€™s unacceptable. I canâ€™t speak for every hospital, of course, but I can promise you that the hospital system in which I work, those are taken VERY seriously.  When one happens, it is not covered up.  It is discussed, reviewed, and reviewed again. Root cause analysis meetings are held to determine what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. Let me give you an example:  in our Neonatal ICU (Iâ€™m a neonatologist) we were having an unacceptably high rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections. We had 3 or 4 in a six month period. Not okay, period. We met, discussed, reviewed, and changed our practices. This July 4th will be FOUR YEARS without an infection!  We are very proud of this change and have worked very hard to maintain that status. 
It doesnâ€™t matter who lives and who dies, or if anyone at all dies this time.  People die of Measles and the other diseases that are making a comeback because of the anti-vaccination movement.  These diseases are becoming a problem again because people donâ€™t get vaccinated and then they keep the virus alive.  These illnesses were beaten down with vaccines and are growing again because people choose not to get them.  The more people get the disease the more people will die from it.  Thatâ€™s statistics for you.  A certain percentage of people die from a disease; if more people have it, more people die.  People that arenâ€™t afraid of diseases because their kids are â€œhealthyâ€? are deluding themselves.  Every kid is healthy, until theyâ€™re not.  Herd immunity is only effective if over 95% of the population is resistant to the disease.  Thanks to the anti-vaccination movement this number is just over 70% and dropping.  Iâ€™ve got news for you people, you canâ€™t all be in the 5%.  Youâ€™d better get concerned with infection, because this outbreak could be mild, but the next one could be the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic all over again, and itâ€™s spread by people who get infected and pass it on and keep it alive.
Thank you for being open about your beliefs, reasons, and science for this very complicated decision.  I do not have children yet, though we are trying, and so I decided to start researching some of these issues so that I would know my position when the time came.  This issue is by far the most difficult/complicated one Iâ€™m struggling with.  The evidence-based part of me comes down on the site of not vaccinating, mostly because I think that the vaccine manufacturers have the burden of proof of safety, efficacy, and necessity and Iâ€™m just not convinced they have itâ€¦ but then thereâ€™s this bullyingâ€¦ this INSANITYâ€¦. and I lose my confidence that not vaccinating is the right decision.  If Iâ€™m honest, Iâ€™m VERY strongly motivated to vaccinate simply because I donâ€™t want to have to have this fight their whole livesâ€¦. how terrible of a reason is THAT?! All this name-calling and fear-mongering does nothing but obscure the facts that everyone has a right to so that we can make educated and informed decisions about what we put in our bodies.  I really appreciate that you are so outspoken about this issue so that those of us out here have some place to start finding real data to make this very important decision for ourselves and our family.
I disagree with your post on many levels, but in aim of brevity and constructive conversation:  I canâ€™t help but find your post to be hypocritical.  Please try to understand why Iâ€™m saying this, as it is not a personal attack, just something I think you should try to be aware of.  Thereâ€™s much hypocrisy in demanding your right to be heard, while signing petitions against othersâ€™ rights to voice opposite opinions.  Also, keep in mind that everyone has a choice.  If your choice is to NOT vaccinate your children, you must accept the (potential) consequences.  Which could be as extreme as illness (again, POTENTIAL consequence) or as inconvenient as not being able to register with some schools, churches, doctors offices, etc.  As it is the equally valid right of people and places to limit access to children that arenâ€™t participating in herd immunity.  Everyone has a right to choose.  You have a right to chose not to vaccinate and take action how you feel necessary, no matter how much others disagree.  And others have the right to disagree, or take action how they feel necessary, no matter how much YOU disagree.
I know you will not publish this comment, as you have stated above, but I hope you take the time to read this article and consider the other side of the issue. Not vitriolic arguments and accusations against you, which as you say are completely unproductive.  I agree. I am instead asking you to re-evaluate your beliefs with new information in hand. Do not limit your research to evidence which supports your existing beliefs, but truly evaluate the core reasoning, and ramifications to real, loving, kind, and deserving people, who rely on their community of friends, neighbors, peers, and families, to keep them safe, as we ALL do, in many ways. 
The biggest problem is that you assume that the idea that herd immunity, the general idea that my child could impact anotherâ€™s health, is a NEW idea to me.  Do you realize hundreds and hundreds have yelled this at me?  Some respectfully (like you) and someâ€¦well, I just canâ€™t repeat what they said.  This is NOT NEW to me whatsoever.  I do not even understand how someone could even think that it would be when itâ€™s they key focus of the propaganda that is published multiple times a day.
I read that story.  And hereâ€™s the thing: that child is at risk from SICK PEOPLE, not unvaccinated people.  Do you understand the difference?  His father clearly doesnâ€™t.  A lot of kids show up to school with bad colds, strep throat, bronchitis (even if they donâ€™t yet know itâ€™s â€œthat badâ€?), stomach viruses, etc.  This is the real danger.  They should be advising kids in his sonâ€™s class to err on the side of caution and stay home if they have any symptoms.  And, they should be having the boy wear a mask because these illnesses we donâ€™t have vaccines for could be just as deadly as the ones we do, in this case.
Should any child get exposed to the measles, or even think they might have been (vaccinated or not), they should stay home.  Sure.  But there is still the possibility that a vaccinated child could catch and spread measles (or pertussis, also common because of massive vaccine failure â€” I could pull up half a dozen recent studies on that easily).  Or that ANY child could bring in strep throat (which in a child with cancer could lead to scarlet fever and death).
Iâ€™d like to know who said they arenâ€™t for preventing disease. Are they health related professionals or is it others who have automatically assumed itâ€™s to prevent. Wrong info can spread like wild fire and then cam be considered what is. In all my classes every single one of my professors have drilled it into our minds about vaccinations because because we have to be advocates on the information about what we are doing or giving them. If you look at every single adverse side affect in every procedure done or down to things over the counter people would not do anything.

The ingredient that everyone said is toxic was a preservative that the FDA pulled from being allowed to use I believe  it was like 2006. Yes it may happen but you have a higher chance of your child dying from a car crash then from them having adverse side effects from vaccines. I just want to make sure true info is being put out there. I have no problems with parents not vaccinating or vaccinating. Itâ€™s your right as a parent but please make sure you really get all info that is considered non biased.
Iâ€™m SOOO glad to see someone else able to view this with a rational mind. I canâ€™t figure out why everyone is upset about the unvaccinated people getting Measlesâ€¦ and not a word about the vaccinated people getting it. Seriously? Nothing to say? Schools not letting unvaccinated kids attend for 2 weeks? Iâ€™m sorry, but if there were an outbreak somewhere, I wouldnâ€™t want my vaccinated kids included eitherâ€¦ itâ€™s not invincibility. Who knows that they arenâ€™t in the 5% the MMR doesnâ€™t work on? Sooo, we only â€œcareâ€? about the unvaccinated kids but not the risk for the vaccinated? The whole thing is ridiculous. I would love more people to set aside their propaganda and take an honest look at thisâ€¦ one that doesâ€™t involve serious kick-backs and national funding and actually considers whatâ€™s best for kidsâ€¦ and lets us parents make that decision. I donâ€™t know a single anti-vaxxer who made that choice flippantly, without a ton of research, or with the hope of being saved by a herd. As you said in a March postâ€¦ ultimately, each parents loves their child (hopefully) and is doing the research and making the best choice for their family, whatever that is. The bullying is ridiculous.
If your thinking of vaccinating, great, youâ€™ve got nothing to worry about, youâ€™ll never catch â€œthatâ€? disease, will you, your vaccinated. So why worry, your safe, your children are safe. Vaccinations always work, right ? Thereâ€™s never been a recorded complication, right? And if so, itâ€™s a small risk, it wont happen to your child, will it. If however, your unsure, perhaps youâ€™d like to know the composition of whatâ€™s being injected directly into your soft tissue, or your childâ€™s, by passing youâ€™re GI tract, or skin for that matter. Well, in that case, ask for an independent analysis, form the an independent laboratory, with the requisite scientific standards in place, guaranteeing, objective, unbiased reporting. Then, you can make an informed decision, right? Or perhaps, ask the medical practitioner to sign off on the â€œfactâ€? that vaccines are 100% safe & effective, making them liable, in case they arenâ€™t. Letâ€™s face it, weâ€™re all the same arenâ€™t we, geneâ€™s or gene expression & genetic mutations couldnâ€™t possibly influence how a foreign synthetic substance will effect our biology & respective response, after all vaccines where designed as a panacea, catering for the whole bell curve, right? If in doubt, you can always fall back on blood letting, or just rub some mercury on your chest; itâ€™s bound to kill something.
